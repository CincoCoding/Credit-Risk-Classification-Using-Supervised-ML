# Credit Risk Classification

Credit risk poses a classification problem that’s inherently imbalanced. This is because healthy loans easily outnumber risky loans. In this Challenge, you’ll use various techniques to train and evaluate models with imbalanced classes. You’ll use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

## Instructions:
Open the Jupyter Notebook. 

This challenge consists of the following subsections:

* Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets

* Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data

* Predict a Logistic Regression Model with Resampled Training Data 

* Repeat process but balance the data first

## Skills: Supervised Learning, Python, numpy, pandas, sklearn, pathlib, Data Cleaning, Machine Learning, Logistic Regression, Oversampling (fix imbalanced data), Confusion Matrix, Classification Report, imblearn
